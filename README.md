How to use the Deployment Manager present in OpenVINO to create a runtime package from our application.

## Packaging your Application
In this exercise we will see how we can use the Deployment Manager present in OpenVINO create a runtime package from our application. These packages can be easily sent to other 
hardware devices to be deployed.

In the video, I will be creating a runtime package of the <code>vtune_project</code> To follow along, you can either use the same project (it is present as a folder in this workspace), or 
you can upload your own application and create a runtime package from it.

You can find detailed instructions about the Deployment Manager [here](https://docs.openvinotoolkit.org/latest/_docs_install_guides_deployment_manager_tool.html).
